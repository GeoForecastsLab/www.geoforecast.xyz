                    Experimental Nature: The "Open Earthquake Predictions Initiative" is an ongoing scientific exploration. Predictions provided on this platform are based on data analysis
                    and modeling, but they are not guaranteed to be accurate or complete.

                    No Obligations: Users are under no obligation to act upon the predictions made here.
                    Our platform is just for information purposes, so it does not impose any 
                    duties or responsibilities.

                    Safety First: We emphasize that the primary concern during earthquake events should always be safety. 
                    Follow official guidance and recommendations from local authorities and experts.
